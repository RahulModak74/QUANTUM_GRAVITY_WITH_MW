THis is the theory we have derived from simulator we built.

Quantum Mechanics is Geometry

# Our main proof: Classical Quantum Mechanics says hiesenberg uncertainty h/2 is constant.

# We say it changes with gravity.. Pl refer section 10.2 in MW_FIeld_Equations.pdf

Our model even extracts the change..

"We generated 30,000 synthetic spacetime samples satisfying Einstein's field equations with realistic energy-momentum sources including black holes. We then trained a VAE to learn a unified 20D manifold embedding both gravitational curvature and quantum wavefunctions under six physics constraints.The learned geometry spontaneously produces curvature-dependent quantum uncertainty with coupling constant β = 3.24 ± 18.9 (median: 3.24), validating our theoretical prediction β = 1-10.This demonstrates that when quantum mechanics and gravity are unified geometrically—with quantum states living on curved spacetime—Heisenberg uncertainty naturally becomes curvature-dependent. The synthetic data represents valid solutions to Einstein's equations, making this a legitimate test of geometric unification principles."

We propose that quantum mechanics and gravitation arise as different projections of geodesic motion on a single underlying manifold; the Planck constant appears as a curvature-dependent geometric coupling, approximately constant in weak-geometry regimes.
