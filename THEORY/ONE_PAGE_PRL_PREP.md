Abstract

General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are traditionally formulated on different mathematical structures: spacetime manifolds and Hilbert spaces. We propose a unifying equivalence principle stating that both theories describe geodesic evolution on a single underlying manifold. Gravity, quantum phase, uncertainty, and singular behavior emerge as geometric properties—curvature, topology, and non-commutativity—of this manifold. This principle reframes the incompatibility between gravity and quantum mechanics as a mismatch of manifolds rather than a fundamental conflict of laws.

1. Introduction

Einstein’s equivalence principle established gravity as a manifestation of geometry rather than force. Quantum mechanics, by contrast, is typically viewed as fundamentally non-geometric. Despite this difference, both theories are governed by extremal action principles and exhibit geometry-dependent phenomena such as curvature-induced forces and phase accumulation. This suggests the possibility of a deeper unification at the level of geometry itself.

2. Modak–Walawalkar Equivalence Principle

We propose the following principle:

All physical systems obeying both gravitational and quantum constraints evolve as geodesic flows on a single underlying manifold endowed with an appropriate metric, curvature, and measure.

In this framework, gravity and quantum mechanics are not separate theories but complementary projections of the same geometric structure.

3. Geodesic Universality

In General Relativity, free particles follow spacetime geodesics, and the Einstein field equations arise from extremizing the Einstein–Hilbert action. In Quantum Mechanics, dominant contributions to physical evolution arise from extremal paths in the Feynman path integral, yielding the Schrödinger equation. Thus, classical and quantum dynamics both arise from geodesic principles, differing only in the geometric structure of the manifold considered.

4. Curvature, Uncertainty, and Topology

Curvature governs dynamics in both theories. In gravity, spacetime curvature produces gravitational acceleration. In quantum mechanics, geometric curvature in state space generates observable phase effects. Non-commutativity of parallel transport on curved manifolds provides a geometric interpretation of quantum uncertainty. Singularities, tunneling, and wave-function collapse indicate that the underlying manifold must admit topological discontinuities rather than global smoothness.

5. Conservation Laws

In both General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, conserved quantities arise from symmetry via Noether’s theorem. This reflects a shared geometric origin: isometries of the underlying manifold generate conservation of energy, momentum, and charge.

6. Consequences and Outlook

This equivalence principle implies that the apparent conflict between gravity and quantum mechanics originates from describing the same geometry on different manifolds. The principle asserts the existence of a unified geometric structure; explicit constructions may be obtained by enforcing physical constraints and extracting the resulting geometry. This opens a constructive pathway toward quantum gravity while preserving the foundational insights of both theories.
