The Modak–Walawalkar Equivalence Principle


1. Motivation

General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics appear incompatible because they are formulated on different mathematical spaces: spacetime manifolds for gravity, and Hilbert spaces for quantum theory. Yet both theories share a deeper structural similarity: physical evolution is determined by extremal principles on curved spaces.

We propose that this apparent incompatibility arises not from physics itself, but from the assumption that gravity and quantum mechanics require different underlying manifolds.

2. The Principle

Modak–Walawalkar Equivalence Principle

All physical systems obeying both gravitational and quantum constraints evolve as geodesic flows on a single underlying manifold endowed with an appropriate metric, curvature, and measure.

In this view:

Gravity and quantum mechanics are not distinct forces or frameworks

They are different manifestations of geometry on the same manifold

3. Geodesic Universality

Both theories are governed by extremal action:

In General Relativity, free particles follow spacetime geodesics, and the field equations arise from extremizing the Einstein–Hilbert action.

In Quantum Mechanics, physical evolution is dominated by extremal paths in the path integral formulation, yielding the Schrödinger equation.

Thus, classical motion and quantum evolution are both geodesic phenomena, differing only in the geometric structure on which they occur.

4. Curvature as Physical Interaction

Curvature determines dynamics in both regimes:

In General Relativity, spacetime curvature governs gravitational motion via the Einstein tensor.

In Quantum Mechanics, geometric curvature in state space produces observable effects such as Berry phase and the Aharonov–Bohm phenomenon.

Curvature is therefore the common source of gravitational force and quantum phase.

5. Uncertainty as Geometry

Non-commutativity is intrinsic to curved manifolds:

In General Relativity, parallel transport depends on path, reflecting curvature.

In Quantum Mechanics, non-commuting observables give rise to Heisenberg uncertainty.

We interpret quantum uncertainty as a geometric consequence of curvature at fundamental scales, rather than an independent postulate.

6. Singularities and Discontinuities

Both theories admit extreme, non-smooth behavior:

Gravitational singularities and horizons in GR

Wave-function collapse, tunneling, and particle creation in QM

These phenomena indicate that the underlying manifold must admit topology change and discontinuities, rather than being globally smooth.

7. Conservation Laws

In both theories, conserved quantities arise from symmetry:

Diffeomorphism invariance in GR

Gauge and unitary symmetries in QM

This reflects a common geometric origin via Noether’s theorem:
symmetries of the manifold generate physical conservation laws.

8. Statement of Unification

Gravity and quantum mechanics are equivalent descriptions of geodesic motion on a unified manifold.

Apparent differences arise from projecting this geometry onto different observational regimes.

General Relativity describes large-scale curvature of this manifold; quantum mechanics describes fine-scale geometric and topological structure.

9. Constructive Existence

The principle asserts existence, not a specific construction.

However, such manifolds can be constructed explicitly by learning metrics consistent with physical constraints and extracting their geometric properties. This demonstrates that the equivalence principle is not merely philosophical, but realizable.

10. Relation to Einstein’s Principle
Einstein	Modak–Walawalkar
Gravity ≡ acceleration	Gravity ≡ quantum evolution
Local indistinguishability	Shared geometric origin
Geometry replaces force	Geometry replaces quantization
Curved spacetime	Unified curved manifold
11. Summary (Einstein-style)

Einstein showed that gravity is not a force but geometry.
We extend this insight: quantum mechanics is also geometry.
Both arise from geodesic motion on a single manifold whose curvature, symmetry, and topology encode physical law.
